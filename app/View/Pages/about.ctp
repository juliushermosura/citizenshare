<i>"Given the challenges we face, education doesn't need to be reformed... it needs to be transformed."</i><b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Sir Ken Robinson<br><br><hr /><br>We are pleased that you found Citizenshare.&nbsp; Here's how we got started... In 2010,&nbsp;<br>after one of our co-founders asked himself the question:&nbsp;What else should we be<br>teaching in our schools? &nbsp;He grew increasingly&nbsp;unsatisfied with our traditional&nbsp;<br>education system and the limited&nbsp;opportunity to learn real-world skills, not soft&nbsp;<br>skills, from teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>How many times have you wished you learned skills in school like:</b><br><br>How to raise capital to start a business, albeit your major in college was French<br>How to design a meal plan to control your weight and live a long, healthy life<br>How to change careers and double your annual salary without going back&nbsp;to school<br>Or, simply, how to wake up and be more productive<br><br><b>Here's the truth.</b><br><br>We convince ourselves there are prerequisites before we do the things that add value to our lives personally and professionally. That voice in our head tells us that it's going to be hard. The voice whispers that we are not ready, not qualified,&nbsp;or aren't good enough, before we can ever do or learn what we really&nbsp;want to.<br><br>What’s consistent across the board is that the happiest people&nbsp;are doing the things&nbsp;<br>that move them in the direction of their dominant thoughts and goals. The dreamers,&nbsp;<br>on the other hand, 'play it safe' and 'by the book', yet constantly worry about what to do next; moreover, they're worried about what their co-workers, friends&nbsp;and family think. They sit on the sidelines of life afraid and watch the DOERS, waiting for those elusive emotional and verbal cues of approval from the people in their lives they are taught really matter. Consequently, they become skeptical and cynical and do nothing.<br><br>So, which are you? Are you doing what you want to do, or are you engaged&nbsp;in merely prerequisites?<br><br><b>Why is that?</b><br><br>If you want to become a math wiz, you learn from someone who knows math well, and then start doing math right away to eventually become a math wiz.&nbsp; If you want to own your own business, you find someone who is successful in business, ask questions, gain feedback, and then go out and start a business.&nbsp; And the same applies for mastering relationships, money, and your health.&nbsp;Sounds simple, right, but why are&nbsp;<br>you not DOING the things that lead to your personal and professional development?<br><br><b>Learn by Doing Real-World Projects</b><br><br>What if you could learn at your own pace, and immediately put what&nbsp;you've learned&nbsp;<br>into practice?&nbsp; What if you could do this from anywhere, at&nbsp;anytime, getting answers&nbsp;<br>to only the subjects that you always wanted to know about. And what if this could all lead to a much more fulfilling life personally and professionally?&nbsp;<br><br>Citizenshare is a community of lifelong learners where you learn how-to skills&nbsp;from teachers with real-world experience. Here we focus on results, not prerequisites.&nbsp;<br><br>The Citizenshare community is made up of awesome people we call&nbsp;<i>Citizens</i>.&nbsp; We&nbsp;<br>are professionals from every walk of life, designers,&nbsp;artists, business owners, and technology nerds.&nbsp; We are very passionate&nbsp;about learning new&nbsp;skills, living a more fulfilling life and making the world a better place.&nbsp;<br><br>We care deeply about the experience each and every one of our teachers,&nbsp;students and partners have, as they share their talents, time and experience with&nbsp;us.&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to Citizenshare.
